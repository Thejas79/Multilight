# Multilight
MultiLight is a Java-based application (possibly IoT or simulation-related) designed to manage multiple lights or devices through a user interface. It might be a desktop GUI app or a backend control system depending on the files inside.

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
The project contains the following components:

src/ â€“ Source code files, likely in Java.

lib/ â€“ Any external JAR dependencies (if included).

assets/ â€“ Icons, configuration, or other resources.

README.md â€“ (Youâ€™re reading it).

multilight.jar or main class â€“ Executable or main entry point.

ðŸš€ How to Run the Project
Option 1: Using an IDE (Eclipse/IntelliJ)
Open your IDE.

Import the project as a Java Project.

Make sure src/ is marked as a source folder.

Add external libraries if needed (lib/ folder).

Locate the main class (e.g., Main.java or MultiLight.java).

Run the main class.

Option 2: Compile and Run via Terminal
bash
Copy
Edit
# Step into the source directory
cd multilight/src

# Compile
javac *.java

# Run
java Main   # or replace with correct main class name
ðŸ§° Requirements
Java JDK 8 or higher

Optional: IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse

Optional: External libraries (check if lib/ folder contains .jar files)

ðŸ”§ Features (Assumed from Project Name)
Multi-light control or simulation

GUI-based light toggling or automation

May simulate IoT behavior or real-world control systems

ðŸ“Œ Notes
If there's a config.properties or similar file, ensure it is correctly configured.

Ensure required libraries (JARs) are added to your project classpath.

If the project uses any GUI library like JavaFX, make sure it is set up in your IDE.
